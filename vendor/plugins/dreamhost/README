Dreamhost FCGIHandler
=====================

Installation: 

script/plugin install http://gabrito.com/svn/plugins/dreamhost

Dreamhost will manage your dispatch.fcgi processes by sending them a TERM signal occasionally.  
In general you want to let Dreamhost manage your processes because otherwise their process 
monitor gets angry. However, receiving a TERM signal while a request is being handled 
results in a 500 error so we need custom TERM handling for Dreamhost which is what this 
plugin does. 

If your dispatch.fcgi is in the middle of handling a request and receives a 
TERM signal this plugin will defer exiting until the request is completed.
