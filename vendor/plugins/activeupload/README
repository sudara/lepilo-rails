ActiveUpload
==========

The activeupload plugin is a rails plugin that enables simple AJAX style uploading of files to a web server. The plugin achieves this by using a slightly modified version of SWFUpload (http://swfupload.mammon.se/) in conjunction with a rails controller to upload the files and populate a database table. Then a custom form helper populates a polymophic association connecting those attachments to any object in your application.

To use this plugin first you must generate the migration, model and controller:

./script/generate activeupload

add the following line to any model to define the polymorphic association to attachments:

  has_many :attachments, :as => :attachable

  def attachment_id=(attachment_id)
    unless attachment_id.blank?
      attachment.clear
      attachment_ids = attachment_id.split(",")
      attachment_ids.each do |a_id|
        unless a_id.blank?
          attachment = Attachment.find(a_id)
          attachments << attachment
        end
      end
    end
  end

  def attachment_id
    returning result = "" do
      if attachments
        attachments.each do |attachment|
          result << ",#{attachment.id}"
        end
      end
    end
  end

Then then to populate the association add the following to your models new and edit views:

  <p>
    <b>Attachments</b><br />
    <%= f.attachments_field :attachment_id, { :add => "true", :edit =>"true", :filesize => 30720, :filetypes => [ "*.gif", "*.jpg", "*.png" ] } %>
  </p>

And add the following to your models show view:

<p>
  <b>Attachments</b>
  <%= view_attachments_field(@bench, {})  %>
</p>

Next, make sure the view helper is accessible to all the views by adding the following line to your app/helpers/application_helper.rb:

  include ActiveUploadHelper

Finally, add the necessary javascript and css to your layout (This plugin uses the prototype library, so make sure you include the defaults javascript if you haven't already):

  <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'swfupload_theme' %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag "swfupload_callbacks.js" %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag "SWFUpload.js" %>
