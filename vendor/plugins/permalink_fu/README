PermalinkFu

This is a simple plugin extracted from Mephisto for creating permalinks from attributes.

  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_permalink :title
  end

This will escape the title, making it fit to use in a URL in the after_validation callback.

Use PermalinkFu.escape to escape a string manually if you like.
